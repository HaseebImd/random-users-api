**Random Users API**

I have successfully created and hosted a Django Rest Framework (DRF) application on Railway. This API provides access to random user data.

**Access Information:**

You can access this API using the following URL:

[Random Users API](https://haseebimdad.up.railway.app/api/randomusers/1)

**Usage:**

To retrieve random user data, you need to provide an integer value between 1 and 100 as a parameter in the URL. The API will return a unique set of random users based on the provided number.

**Example:**

- Access the API using the URL mentioned above.

- Append an integer between 1 and 100 to the URL, like so:

   ```
   https://haseebimdad.up.railway.app/api/randomusers/5
   ```

   This will return a set of 5 random users.

**Note:** The API is designed to provide a unique set of random users based on the specified number. You can experiment with different numbers to retrieve varying user datasets.

Feel free to explore and utilize this API for your needs. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out.
